OpenRocket simulations version control

**All ork files must be unzipped to merge if using OpenRocket**

**Make sure that the pre-commit hook found in hooks/ is in .git/hooks, otherwise your .ork files will be weird**

## ASTRA

ART's family of testbed rockets, used to demonstrate systems used on record attempts.

### ASTRA Mk 1

G-Class motor, testing LENNY and APEX Components.
Flight on Sunday 11th April 2021 at MRC; 546m apogee. RUD upon landing.

### ASTRA Mk 2
ART's second flight, demonstrating APEX Recovery systems
G-Class motor
Flight on Sunday 13th June 2021 at MRC; 523m apogee. Mostly successful.
